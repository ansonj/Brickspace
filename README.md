# Brickspace

An iPad application that counts your Lego bricks and tells you what to build.

By [Anson Jablinski](http://ansonj.org). Created for the [University of Houston](http://uh.edu)'s 2014 Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship project, and developed under the supervision of Ioannis Kakadiaris and the [UH Computational Biomedicine Laboratory](http://cbl.uh.edu/).

Detailed information about the app is available at [the project website](http://ansonj.org/brickspace).

The [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) framework for iOS (not included) is required to build Brickspace. OpenCV is used to detect bricks in the captured image and estimate their color.
